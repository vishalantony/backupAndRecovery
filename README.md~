BACKUP AND RECOVERY OF A FILE.<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
ASKED IN COMMVAULT 2nd ROUND FOR THE YEAR 2015 (Campus Recruitment).<br>
<br>
OBJECTIVES:<br>
1. Backup and restore a file.<br>
2. Add versioning. A file can have multiple versions.<br>
3. Delete : mark for delete. Don't free up the file contents.<br>
4. Pruning : free the file contents.<br>
<br>
Files are taken as strings for simplicity.<br>
Versions are in the form of numbers.<br>
Read and write should be done in terms of chunks (say 16 bytes).<br>
The chunks are allocated from a virtual hard disk.<br>
Try to make your solution scalable.<br>
<br>
<br>
PS: I couldn't clear this round. I coded this solution just to understand how it is done.
I've tried my best to avoid any errors. But since human mind is prone to errors, you can expect these codes
too to have many.<br>
The objective specified is what i can remember. I've tried to incorporate all what i can remember.
Sorry if I have missed out any points.<br>
